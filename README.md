# PolyCurveFitting_RegressionOLS
Exercise 1

  Given the following house square feet: 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and the following house
  prices: 50000, 100000, 200000, 400000, 600000, 800000. Create noise derived from a standard nor-
  mal (Gaussian) distribution function (i.e., one with 0 mean and 1 standard deviation). Use Ordinary Least
  Squares to find the regression line parameters, estimate the SSE (Sum of Squared Error), and
  find the Correlation Coefficient. Plot the data points with and without noise, along with the
  regression lines with and without noise, and predict house prices for the following square feet:
  200, 1250, 2710, 5100
  
Exercise 2
  
  Based on Ex. 1, find the Least Squares Regression Line using the Matrix Algebra method.
  Verify whether you get the same regression line parameters as in Ex. 1. Plot the data points, after
  noise addition, along with the regression line
 
Exercise 3
  
  Perform Polynomial Curve Fitting on the following dataset: (-2, 3), (-1, 5), (0, 1), (1, 4), (2,
  10). Print the coefficients and plot the graph of the polynomial function 
  
  Note 1: Do not use any built-in functions such as polyfit() or polyval(). You can use the
  functions np.matmul() and np.linalg.inv() to multiply matrices and get the inverse of a matrix,
  respectively
  
  Note 2: Your algorithm should be able to work with any dataset not just a dataset of 5 data
  points
